## 🚀 About Me
👋 Hey! I’m Mohamed Riham, currently pursuing my BSc (Hons) in Data Science at ICBT. I’m interested in AI, data science, and game development, and I love learning how technology can be used to solve real problems and create new experiences.

I’ve worked on projects like AI voice assistants, face recognition systems, banking chatbots, and assistive devices for visually impaired users. Every project helps me learn, explore, and improve a little more.

Right now, I’m focused on learning new data science concepts and experimenting with game development whenever I can. For me, it’s all about growing, creating, and enjoying the process of learning.
